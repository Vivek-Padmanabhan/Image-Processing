Image-Processing
================

Worked on an alternate design solution for tracking multiple objects under varied kinds of occlusion. The project involved detecting an object in an image by separating foreground from the background. From the possible multiple objects in the foreground, segment individual objects. Once segmented, the object is tracked by drawing a box around it through a sequence of images in a video. The objective was to persistently track the same object with or without occlusion. Using the MATLAB Environment, I developed scripts to track objects in standardized recorded sequence and live captured sequences. Also developed a prototype web application to deploy the design solution as a service.
